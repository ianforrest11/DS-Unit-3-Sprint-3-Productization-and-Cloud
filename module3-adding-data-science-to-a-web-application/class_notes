- ENV attribute does not protect keys, need to change to FLASK_ENV
- not good for decouple
- flask relies on dotenv()

app.py responsible for config/routing...app 'factory'
- shouldnt be doing detailed things, thats for twitter.py

Online vs offline machine learning
- at request time, things happen, pulls data, models trained, etc
- all fine, but also could not be fine...if get good model, could be heavy and expensive to run
- if train offline, train more cheaply, import to online from saved ML object

Sprint Challenge:
- build a working basic flask application
- hit a basic API, much less complicated than twitter, no authentication required
